Comparing P2a against P2b:

- New classes:
I have implemented extra intermediate classes such as FloatingObject, Powers, and RandomMoveObject that are
superclasses to certain game objects with those properties. These new classes are abstract as they include a few common
methods and properties. By doing so, I minimised the usage of down-casting and repeated code in the subclasses.

- Removal of interfaces:
I have deleted some interfaces that do not serve >1 class.

- GameSetting class to get level input
Initially, my ShadowMario has a method that gets the input level/csv files. Npw, I placed this method in my GameSetting
class for a better design.
